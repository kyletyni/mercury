This is a custom PCB and software design I created to compete in the APEC Micromouse competition in 2024. 
The design is based on the ESP32-S3 which is a dual core microprocessor. 
The pcb design was done in Kicad 7.0 and the MCU was programmed using the esp-idf utilizing RTOS for time sensitive task scheduling.
