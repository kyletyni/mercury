This is a custom PCB and software design I created to compete in the APEC Micromouse 
competition in 2024. The design is based on the ESP32-S3 which is a dual core 
microprocessor. The pcb design was done in Kicad 7.0 and the MCU was programmed using 
the esp-idf utilizing RTOS for time sensitive task scheduling.

This is what the PCB looked like when it was delivered.
